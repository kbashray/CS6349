# CS 6349 F23 Programming Project
Privacy Preserving eCommerce System

In order to compile the program run the included makefile with the make command or run the included make.bat file if you're on Windows.

To run the program use the following commands:  
	java Broker  
	java Customer 1  
	java Customer 2  
	java Merchant  
	
These commands start the broker, two customers, and merchant respectively. The broker always needs to be started first, as it acts as the server for the merchant and customers to connect to.

The included login credentials for customers are the following:  
	user1 : password1  
	user2 : password2
